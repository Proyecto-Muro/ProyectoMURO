EGMO 2021 problem 1:  The number 2021 is fantabulous. For any positive integer $m$, if any element of the set $\{m, 2m+1, 3m\}$ is fantabulous, then all the elements are fantabulous. Does it follow that the number $2021^{2021}$ is fantabulous? 
EGMO 2021 problem 2:  Find all functions $f:\mathbb{Q}\to\mathbb{Q}$ such that the equation
\[ f(xf(x)+y) = f(y) + x^2 \]
holds for all rational numbers $x$ and $y$. \\\\
Here, $\mathbb{Q}$ denotes the set of rational numbers. 
EGMO 2021 problem 3:  Let $ABC$ be a triangle with an obtuse angle at $A$. Let $E$ and $F$ be the intersections of the external bisector of angle $A$ with the altitudes of $ABC$ through $B$ and $C$ respectively. Let $M$ and $N$ be the points on the segments $EC$ and $FB$ respectively such that $\angle EMA = \angle BCA$ and $\angle ANF = \angle ABC$. Prove that the points $E, F, N, M$ lie on a circle.

\begin{itemize}
  \item no three points in $P$ lie on a line and
  \item no two points in $P$ lie on a line through the origin.
\end{itemize}
A triangle with vertices in $P$ is \textit{fat} if $O$ is strictly inside the triangle. Find the maximum number of fat triangles. 
EGMO 2021 problem 6:  Does there exist a nonnegative integer $a$ for which the equation
\[
\left\lfloor\frac{m}{1}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{m}{3}\right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor\frac{m}{m}\right\rfloor = n^2 + a
\]
has more than one million different solutions $(m, n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers? \\\\
\textit{The expression $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the integer part (or floor) of the real number $x$. Thus $\lfloor\sqrt{2}\rfloor = 1, \lfloor\pi\rfloor =\lfloor 22/7 \rfloor = 3, \lfloor 42\rfloor = 42,$ and $\lfloor 0 \rfloor = 0$.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item $x_1 \le x_2 \le \ldots \le x_{2020}$;
  \item $x_{2020} \le x_1  + 1$;
  \item there is a permutation $(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{2020})$ of $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2020})$ such that
\[ \sum_{i = 1}^{2020} ((x_i + 1)(y_i + 1))^2 = 8 \sum_{i = 1}^{2020} x_i^3. \]
\end{itemize}
\textit{A permutation of a list is a list of the same length, with the same entries, but the entries are allowed to be in any order.  For example, $(2, 1, 2)$ is a permutation of $(1, 2, 2)$, and they are both permutations of $(2, 2, 1)$.  Note that any list is a permutation of itself.} 
EGMO 2020 problem 3:  Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex hexagon such that $\angle A = \angle C = \angle E$ and $\angle B = \angle D = \angle F$ and the (interior) angle bisectors of $\angle A, ~\angle C,$ and $\angle E$ are concurrent. \\\\
Prove that the (interior) angle bisectors of $\angle B, ~\angle D, $ and $\angle F$ must also be concurrent. \\\\
\textit{Note that $\angle A = \angle FAB$.  The other interior angles of the hexagon are similarly described.} 
EGMO 2020 problem 4:  A permutation of the integers $1, 2, \ldots, m$ is called \textit{fresh} if there exists no positive integer $k < m$ such that the first $k$ numbers in the permutation are $1, 2, \ldots, k$ in some order.  Let $f_m$ be the number of fresh permutations of the integers $1, 2, \ldots, m$. \\\\
Prove that $f_n \ge n \cdot f_{n - 1}$ for all $n \ge 3$. \\\\
\textit{For example, if $m = 4$, then the permutation $(3, 1, 4, 2)$ is fresh, whereas the permutation $(2, 3, 1, 4)$ is not.} 
EGMO 2020 problem 5:  Consider the triangle $ABC$ with $\angle BCA > 90^{\circ}$.  The circumcircle $\Gamma$ of $ABC$ has radius $R$.  There is a point $P$ in the interior of the line segment $AB$ such that $PB = PC$ and the length of $PA$ is $R$.

(A domino is a tile of size $2 \times 1$ or $1 \times 2$. Dominoes are placed on the board in such a way that each domino covers exactly two cells of the board, and dominoes do not overlap. Two cells are said to be adjacent if they are different and share a common side.) 
EGMO 2019 problem 3:  Let $ABC$ be a triangle such that $\angle CAB > \angle ABC$, and let $I$ be its incentre. Let $D$ be the point on segment $BC$ such that $\angle CAD = \angle ABC$. Let $\omega$ be the circle tangent to $AC$ at $A$ and passing through $I$. Let $X$ be the second point of intersection of $\omega$ and the circumcircle of $ABC$.

(Here, $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the integer part of real number $x$, that is, the largest integer that does not exceed $x$.) 
EGMO 2019 problem 6:  On a circle, Alina draws $2019$ chords, the endpoints of which are all different. A point is considered \textit{marked} if it is either \\\\
$\text{(i)}$ one of the $4038$ endpoints of a chord; or \\\\
$\text{(ii)}$ an intersection point of at least two chords. \\\\
Alina labels each marked point. Of the $4038$ points meeting criterion $\text{(i)}$, Alina labels $2019$ points with a $0$ and the other $2019$ points with a $1$. She labels each point meeting criterion $\text{(ii)}$ with an arbitrary integer (not necessarily positive). \\
Along each chord, Alina considers the segments connecting two consecutive marked points. (A chord with $k$ marked points has $k-1$ such segments.) She labels each such segment in yellow with the sum of the labels of its two endpoints and in blue with the absolute value of their difference. \\
Alina finds that the $N + 1$ yellow labels take each value $0, 1, . . . , N$ exactly once. Show that at least one blue label is a multiple of $3$. \\

EGMO 2012 problem 3:  Find all functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ such that
\[ f\left( {yf(x + y) + f(x)} \right) = 4x + 2yf(x + y) \]
for all $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$. \\\\

EGMO 2012 problem 4:  A set $A$ of integers is called \textit{sum-full} if $A \subseteq A + A$, i.e. each element $a \in A$ is the sum of some pair of (not necessarily different) elements $b,c \in A$. A set $A$ of integers is said to be \textit{zero-sum-free} if $0$ is the only integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of the elements of a finite nonempty subset of $A$. \\
Does there exist a sum-full zero-sum-free set of integers? \\\\

EGMO 2012 problem 5:  The numbers $p$ and $q$ are prime and satisfy
\[ \frac{p}{{p + 1}} + \frac{{q + 1}}{q} = \frac{{2n}}{{n + 2}} \]
for some positive integer $n$. Find all possible values of $q-p$. \\\\

EGMO 2012 problem 6:  There are infinitely many people registered on the social network Mugbook. Some pairs of (different) users are registered as friends, but each person has only finitely many friends. Every user has at least one friend. (Friendship is symmetric; that is, if $A$ is a friend of $B$, then $B$ is a friend of $A$.) \\
Each person is required to designate one of their friends as their best friend. If $A$ designates $B$ as her best friend, then (unfortunately) it does not follow that $B$ necessarily designates $A$ as her best friend. Someone designated as a best friend is called a $1$-best friend. More generally, if $n> 1$ is a positive integer, then a user is an $n$-best friend provided that they have been designated the best friend of someone who is an $(n-1)$-best friend. Someone who is a $k$-best friend for every positive integer $k$ is called popular.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Prove that every popular person is the best friend of a popular person.
  \item Show that if people can have infinitely many friends, then it is possible that a popular person is not the best friend of a popular person.
\end{enumerate}

EGMO 2012 problem 7:  Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$ and orthocentre $H$. Let $K$ be a point of $\Gamma$ on the other side of $BC$ from $A$. Let $L$ be the reflection of $K$ in the line $AB$, and let $M$ be the reflection of $K$ in the line $BC$. Let $E$ be the second point of intersection of $\Gamma $ with the circumcircle of triangle $BLM$. \\
Show that the lines $KH$, $EM$ and $BC$ are concurrent. (The orthocentre of a triangle is the point on all three of its altitudes.) \\\\

EGMO 2012 problem 8:  A \textit{word} is a finite sequence of letters from some alphabet. A word is \textit{repetitive} if it is a concatenation of at least two identical subwords (for example, $ababab$ and $abcabc$ are repetitive, but $ababa$ and $aabb$ are not). Prove that if a word has the property that swapping any two adjacent letters makes the word repetitive, then all its letters are identical. (Note that one may swap two adjacent identical letters, leaving a word unchanged.) \\\\
